 in life. Living cells use iron in a range of biological phenomena, such as metabolism, DNA replication/copy, 
 and gene expression. On the other hand, iron has been detected in many exoplanets (planets outside the Solar 
 System). A curious example is an extreme planet where it apparently rains iron. Daytime temperatures in this 
 giant exoplanet increase up to 2400 Â°C, which is sufficient to evaporate metals. Not just exoplanets, 
 the importance of iron dates back to the formation of terrestrial planets (Mercurius, Venus, Earth, and Mars).
Jon Wade, Hal Drakesmith, and their colleagues explored the contribution of iron bioavailability to the 
biosphere of the Earth by studying available scientific articles. Moreover, they took into account several 
events that affected geological history. They argued that creating a planetary core acts as a restriction 
on both the long life and arrangement of surface water on the crust, determining if the planet is habitable.
Wade and collaborators reported on the impact of different conditions of rocky planet development on the 
early content of iron and the capacity of the mantle to sustain surface water on these planets. On Earth, 
The Great Oxygenation Event was caused roughly 2.4 billion years ago by cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) 
that utilize a range of photosynthetic pigments. During this event, the increase in atmospheric oxygen 
lowered the quantity of soluble iron by gigatons ( one billion metric tons). Moreover, the event led to 
the development of potent evolutionary pressures, which transferred the leading supply of iron to biotic 
sources and not geologic sources. The Great Oxygenation Event resulted in different infectious, scavenging, and 
interdependent behaviors. On the othe,r hand, the multicellular property of eukaryotes
